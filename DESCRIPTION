Description: An integrated R interface to several United States Census Bureau 
    APIs (<https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html>) and the US Census Bureau's 
    geographic boundary files. Allows R users to return Census and ACS data as 
    tidyverse-ready data frames, and optionally returns a list-column with feature geometry for mapping 
    and spatial analysis.
