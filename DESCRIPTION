Description: An integrated R interface to the decennial US Census and American Community Survey APIs and
    the US Census Bureau's geographic boundary files. Allows R users to return Census and ACS data as
    tidyverse-ready data frames, and optionally returns a list-column with feature geometry for all Census 
    geographies.
