\title{Install a CENSUS API Key in Your \code{.Renviron} File for Repeated Use}
\usage{
census_api_key(key = NA, overwrite = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{The API key provided to you from the Census formated in quotes. A key can be acquired at \url{http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html}}

\item{overwrite}{If this is set to TRUE, it will overwrite an existing CENSUS_KEY that you already have in your \code{.Renviron} file.}
}
\description{
This function will add your CENSUS API key to your \code{.Renviron} file so it can be called securely without being stored
in your code. After you have installed your key, it can be called any time by typing \code{Sys.getenv("CENSUS_KEY")} and can be
used in package functions by simply typing CENSUS_KEY If you do not have an \code{.Renviron} file, the function will create on for you.
If you already have an \code{.Renviron} file, the function will append the key to your existing file, while making a backup of your
original file for disaster recovery purposes.

\examples{

\dontrun{
census_api_key("111111abc")
# First time, relead your enviornment so you can use the key without restarting R.
readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
# You can check it with:
Sys.getenv("CENSUS_KEY")
}

\dontrun{
# If you need to overwrite an existing key:
census_api_key("111111abc", overwrite = TRUE)
# First time, relead your enviornment so you can use the key without restarting R.
readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
# You can check it with:
Sys.getenv("CENSUS_KEY")
